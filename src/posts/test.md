# <ul>Yesterday was GPT-5 Day</ul>

When I am writing this GPT-5 was released 24 hours ago. What can it do?

When it comes to [Humanity's last exam](https://agi.safe.ai/) we and see another step in improvement in GPT-5. But, 
this time it is notable the gap in release between GPT-4 & 5.

And everything will render with:
- Auto-linked headings (`# Heading` → `<h1 id="heading">…</h1>`)
- Syntax highlighting with your chosen theme
- GitHub-style checklists
- Smart typography
- Tables

---

### ✅ Summary

- `remarkPlugins` handle **Markdown parsing** features (tables, task lists, smart quotes).
- `rehypePlugins` handle **HTML transformations** (headings with IDs, syntax highlighting).
- Tailwind Typography gives you **consistent styles** out of the box.

---

Do you want me to also wire up **copy-to-clipboard buttons** on code blocks (common in blogs), since you’re already rendering them with `rehype-pretty-code`?
